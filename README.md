# Monitoring Resources in Function-as-a-Service Platforms

In this work, was created a system that gives the developer the tools to be able to instrument function execution and collect information from monitoring tools, for example, Prometheus. To achieve this, a metrics module to work in FaaS platforms and a service to process and store the generated data, were developed. The module will allow developers to register what they need, e.g., the time it takes to execute only part of the function or count the number of times a condition occurs. Initially, the registered data is going to be stored locally, only during the execution of the function, then it is pushed to the service that processes and stores it, e.g., increments the number of times a condition occurs and then stores that value. The service also provides an endpoint for monitoring tools. This solution allows us to: (1) have a platform-independent system; (2) minimize the data stored in the FaaS platform; (3) post-data processing is simplified and (4) the developer can monitor the function execution using monitoring tools, like Prometheus.
